    about: {
        bio: `I’m a BSIT student at the University of Cebu with a deep passion for technology, creativity, and problem-solving. I specialize in frontend web development and UI/UX design, with a growing curiosity for full-stack development using Node.js.

Beyond the web, I explore the world of IoT, embedded systems, and AI technologies, which allows me to combine hardware and software into meaningful solutions. I enjoy transforming ideas into digital experiences, whether it’s designing interfaces, building interactive prototypes, or creating systems that solve real-world problems.

Creativity is at the center of my work — I love designing visually appealing layouts, editing graphics, crafting music mixes, and using AI tools to enhance productivity. I’m also a critical and flexible thinker, able to adapt quickly to new tasks, technologies, and environments.

I believe in continuous learning, curiosity-driven development, and building solutions that leave an impact, no matter how small. My goal is to keep growing as a full-stack developer while integrating AI and IoT into my future projects.`
